(1) create a model to estimate the incoming traffic through different social medias, ad campaigns and direct organic search. This will be a type of click through rate model i.e. CTR model.
(2) create a model to approximate the sensitive page rank system by google. This will be a page rank model to predict the ranking of user pages. Try to include google analytics result and other platform analytics result in this one for mocking search results.
