# Current goals: 
complete phase 1


# phase 1:
(1) create a program to search for a company's name, industry, or keywords and count the instances of the company's name.

This number is the company's BASIC "ranking".

We will have to add additional parameters to scale down how much data is parsed.

(2) Search a few notable companies and store their rankings

# phase 2:
(1) GUI to compare company's online presence

# phase 3:
1) Create plug-in that will overwrite existing for the purposes of staying up to date with prevailing algorithms.



# SEO-Plugin
This Plugin will allow companies to have a larger presence on the web and improve search results.

By collecting data from a targeted company, client, or whomever, this plug-in is intended to "bundle" all social media and mentions of a company thereby boosting that entity's web presence.
